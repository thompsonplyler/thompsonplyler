I love making things that help people or make them smile. My focus as a developer is on JavaScript/React, Python/Flask, Ruby/Rails, but I've picked up bits and pieces of other tools along the way. I love making bits and pieces connecting Blender, ThreeJS, and other tools for display on the web. I also maintained my CCNA for years, and while I haven't worked as a sysadmin for a long time, I love learning about and understanding all the moving pieces and data of the computers themselves and the TCP/IP (etc.) that ties them all together, apart from code. 

- 👯 I’m especially interested in collaborating on projects involving ThreeJS on Unreal Engine...
- 🤖 ... or projects where I can use agentic workflows with LLMs and other AI tools in mind-shattering ways. 
- 🐉 ... or any project, basically, connecting my skillset to Dungeons & Dragons / Pathfinder 2e. 🧙
- 📫 The best way to reach me is probably LinkedIn or e-mail: thompson (at) the domain below...

### Bits and Pieces
- I was a United States Marine. My MOS was computer technician, where I went from from desktop support to network support to information assurance/ cybersecurity. Semper Fi.
- I went to NYU for film school. I fell into graphics/ VFX/ motion graphics after that, where I worked on the gritty technical part (roto, keying, titles/subtitles, credits, painting/wire/object removal) of VFX on dozens of TV shows, commercials, and movies. If you can see my work, I didn't do a good job. I'm ELATED that AI is vaporizing all the tedious parts in that industry. No one LIKES to rotoscope, y'all.
- I was a semi-professional stand-up comic. Paid for beers and dates, but never paid my rent. But I'm only TRULY comfortable with a microphone in my hand.
- 💪 I was a strength and fitness coach for five years. 
  - The best book to start with for serious training is Mark Verstegen's *Core Performance.*
  - My favorite recommendation for best overall fitness text for optimal physical performance (i.e. not merely weight loss or getting swole) is Mark Verstegen's *Every Day is Game Day*. 
- I love tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. I would play Pathfinder 2e 7 days a week if it didn't demand so much darn time. 
- I love books, movies, TV, and video games. Here are some that I think you should enjoy:
  - 📚 *Consider the Lobster* by David Foster Wallace, *The Art of Learning* by Josh Waitzkin, *The Talent Code* by Daniel Coyle
  - 🎬 (only since 2010) *Arrival*, *Cloud Atlas*, *Parasite*
  - 💀 (horror movies) *Martyrs (2008)*, *The Substance*, *Hereditary*  
  - 📺 *Mad Men*, *Severance*, *Handmaid's Tale*, *This is Us*, *Breaking Bad*, RIP *The OA*, RIP Archive *81*
  - 🎮 *League of Legends*, *Disco Elysium*, *Planescape: Torment*, *Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous*, *Expedition 33*, *Sifu*, *Elden Ring*, *Baldur's Gate 3*
- Yes, I am the anti-TL;DR. Why use 20 words when you can use 20,000?
