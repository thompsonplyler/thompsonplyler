I love making things that help people or make them smile. My focus as a developer is on JavaScript/React and Ruby/Rails, but I've picked up bits and pieces of other tools along the way. I also maintained my CCNA for years, and while I haven't worked as a sysadmin for many years, I love learning about and understanding all the moving pieces and data of the computers themselves and the TCP/IP (etc.) that ties them all together, apart from code. 

Proud to work on the Enterprise education team at [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/), where we're helping to educate and empower the next generation of makers and dreamers.

### Bits and Pieces
- I was a United States Marine. My job was as a network technician. 
- I went to NYU for film school. I fell into graphics/ VFX/ motion graphics after that, where I worked on the gritty technical part (roto, keying, titles/subtitles, credits, painting/wire/object removal) of VFX on dozens of TV shows, commercials, and movies.
- 💪 I was a strength and fitness coach for five years. 
  - The best book to start with for serious training is Mark Verstegen's *Core Performance.*
  - My favorite recommendation for best overall fitness text for optimal physical performance (i.e. not merely weight loss or getting swole) is Mark Verstegen's *Every Day is Game Day*. 
- I love tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. I would play Pathfinder 2e 7 days a week if it didn't demand so much darn time. 
- I love books, movies, TV, and video games. Here are some that I think you should enjoy:
  - 📚 *Consider the Lobster* by David Foster Wallace, *The Art of Learning* by Josh Waitzkin, *The Talent Code* by Daniel Coyle
  - 🎬 (only since 2010) *Arrival*, *Cloud Atlas*, *Parasite*
  - 💀 (horror movies) *Martyrs (2008)*, *Fear Street*, *Hereditary* 
  - 📺 *Mad Men*, *Handmaid's Tale*, *This is Us*, *Breaking Bad*, RIP *The OA*, RIP Archive *81*
  - 🎮 *League of Legends*, *Disco Elysium*, *Planescape: Torment*, *Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous*, *Doom: Eternal*
